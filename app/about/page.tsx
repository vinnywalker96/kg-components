            <p className="mb-4">
              KG-Components was founded in 2023 with a simple mission: to provide electronics enthusiasts, 
              makers, and professionals with high-quality components at competitive prices. What started as 
              a small operation has grown into a comprehensive electronic components supplier serving 
              customers worldwide.

            <p>
              We understand the frustration of working on a project only to discover you&apos;re missing a 
              critical component or receiving poor-quality parts that don&apos;t work as expected. That&apos;s why 
              we&apos;ve built our business around reliability, quality, and excellent customer service.

            <p>
              Our mission is to empower creators and innovators by providing reliable electronic
